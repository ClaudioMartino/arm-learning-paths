## The exponential function
The exponential function is a fundamental mathematical function used across a wide range of algorithms for signal processing, High-Performance Computing and Machine Learning. Optimizing its computation has been the subject of extensive research for decades. 

The precision of the computation depends both on the selected approximation method and on the inherent rounding errors associated with finite-precision arithmetic, and it is directly traded off against performance when implementing the exponential function. 

The Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), introduced with the Armv8-A architecture, includes a dedicated instruction to accelerate the exponential function: FEXPA. Although initially not supported in SME, the FEXPA instruction has been made available in Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) version 2.2.
